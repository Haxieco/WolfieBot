# WolfieBot V0.1.0

WolfieBot is a Python based Discord bot used for playing Werewolf in a Discord Voice channel.

## Installation

Run the `main.py` file once to generate a config file, and then edit the file to include your Discord bot Token and User ID.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage

Upon inviting this bot to your server, and starting the file for the first time with a Token, the bot will prompt you for a setup, follow the instructions provided in the Direct Messages, and it will complete setup. 
Make sure that you enable direct messages on the mutual server with the bot, or globally via discord.
